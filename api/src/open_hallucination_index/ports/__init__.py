"""
Ports Layer (Hexagonal Architecture)
====================================

Abstract interfaces defining the contracts between the application core
and external systems. These are the "ports" that adapters plug into.

Primary Ports (driving):
- API endpoints drive the application

Secondary Ports (driven):
- ClaimDecomposer: Text → Claims transformation
- KnowledgeStore: Fact retrieval (graph + vector)
- LLMProvider: Language model inference
- CacheProvider: Semantic caching
