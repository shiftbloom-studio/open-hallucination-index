## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our commitment to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/open-hallucination-index.git
   cd open-hallucination-index
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/open-hallucination-index.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.14+ (for the API)
- Node.js 22+ (for the frontend)
- Git

### API Setup

```bash
cd api

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Tests

**API:**
```bash
cd api

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/open_hallucination_index --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_scorer.py -v
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Code Quality Tools

**API (Python):**
```bash
cd api

# Linting
ruff check src tests

# Fix auto-fixable issues
ruff check src tests --fix

# Formatting
ruff format src tests

# Type checking
mypy src
```

**Frontend (TypeScript):**
```bash
cd frontend

# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-new-verification-strategy`
- `fix/correct-score-calculation`
- `docs/update-api-documentation`
- `refactor/improve-cache-performance`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

```
type(scope): short description

Longer description if needed.

Fixes #123
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

Examples:
- `feat(scorer): add evidence-ratio based scoring`
- `fix(mcp): handle connection timeout gracefully`
- `docs(readme): update quick start guide`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest upstream changes:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them

4. **Run tests and linting**:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ruff check src tests
   mypy src
   ```

5. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference to any related issues
   - Screenshots/examples if applicable

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and follow conventions
- [ ] No unnecessary files are included

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting. Key points:

- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Quotes**: Double quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Sorted with isort rules
- **Docstrings**: Google style

Example:
```python
async def verify_claim(
    self,
    claim: Claim,
    strategy: VerificationStrategy | None = None,
) -> tuple[VerificationStatus, CitationTrace]:
    """
    Verify a single claim against knowledge sources.

    Args:
        claim: The claim to verify.
        strategy: Verification strategy to use (or default).

    Returns:
        Tuple of (verification status, citation trace with evidence).
    """
    ...
```

### Type Hints

- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` for forward references
- Prefer `X | None` over `Optional[X]`

### Architecture

Follow the hexagonal architecture pattern:
- **Domain**: Pure business logic, no external dependencies
- **Ports**: Abstract interfaces
- **Adapters**: Concrete implementations
- **Application**: Use-case orchestration
